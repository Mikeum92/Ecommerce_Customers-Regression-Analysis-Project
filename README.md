# Ecommerce_Customers-Regression-Analysis-Project

This project analysis an Ecommerce company customers' data to decide on part of business to develop (App or Website) in order to boost yearly profite based on thier behaviours.

The company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website. 

In this project, I try to figure out what will be the suitable approach to the problem.

Some Exploratory Data Analysis is done to better visualize relationship between features in data.

Linear Regression Model is built to yearly amount spent by customer base off their habit in store platforms

The performence of the model is evaluated using regression metrics:
    - MAE: Mean Absolute Error 
    - MSE: Mean Squared Error
    - RMSE: Root Mean Squared Error

Since this is a competence training project, fake data is been used!
